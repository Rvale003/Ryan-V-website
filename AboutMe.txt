<p><br><br><br><br><br><br> I was born and raised in Norfolk, Virginia and have been here my whole life so far.
<br>Growing up I was always hanging out with my siblings and cousins, family was and still is very important.
<br>In grade school I was always involved in sports, I was very active in the sports scene as a youth.
<br>I am just your average dude that loves the simple things in life.
<br> I love music, games, sports, and TV shows/Movies, as well as being around genuine people that I care about like family and friends.</p>
