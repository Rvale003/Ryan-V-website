<h1>My two Favorite Foods</h1>

<p>Out of all the options, I would have to say that my two favorite dishes are fettuccine alfredo and chicken adobo.</p>
<p>Ever since the first time I had some alfredo as a young kid I just loved it. I was always a fan of pasta, spaghetti was great but when I first had some nice fettuccine with alfredo sauce combined with chicken and broccoli, I was like "dang this is different". I love adding mushrooms and sometimes red pepper flakes as well as chicken and broccoli in the dish. </p>

<p>Also, growing up in a Filipino household my grandparents would always cook amazing Filipino dishes. My favorite dish that they made was chicken adobo, a Filipino dish involving meat marinated in vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, bay leaves, and black peppercorns, which is browned in oil, and simmered in the marinade. Every time my grandparents made chicken adobo, the chicken was always on point, and was complimented with diced potatoes. The best part to me about the dish was the sabaw (soup or broth) from the dish that I would put over the rice and eat with the chicken and potatoes. Below is a picture of chicken adobo, in case if you were curious.</p>
