<h1>Sports</h1>

<p style="border: 2px Solid Tomato;">I love basketball & football, they were my favorite sports to play and watch growing up, and still are my favorite sports now.</p>
<h2>Basketball(NBA)</h2>
<p>Russell Westbrook<br><img src="https://media.philstar.com/photos/2019/04/26/westbrook-okc-nba_2019-04-26_09-40-10.jpg" alt="Russell Westbrook" width="380" height="260"><br>Kevin Durant<br><img src="https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2020/04/03/170b6d9e-93bc-4c34-bc60-7f842fd8818a/thumbnail/1200x675/668a086c252030f985132a23e5b0dd04/kd.jpg" width="380" height="260"></p>
<p style="border: 2px Solid DodgerBlue;">While I do not have a favorite basketball team anymore, my favorite players to watch and follow are Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant.<br>I am a bigger fan of Russell Westbrook, I enjoy the passion and energy he brings to his team, my favorite part of his game is the explosiveness he has when attacking the rim.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64UgqleIlZY&t=3s&ab_channel=HickoJunior" target="_blank">Watch Russell Westbrook's most hyped plays!</a> </p>
<p style="border: 2px Solid DodgerBlue;">As a basketball fan I love listening to stories about the game and players talking about the game of basketball in general, as well as their off the court life.<br>There is one podcast that I absolutely love called "All The Smoke" hosted by former players Matt Barnes & Stephen Jackson, check it out on apple podcasts <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/all-the-smoke/id1483638752" target="_blank">All The Smoke</a>  </p>
<h2>Football(NFL)</h2>
<p>Peyton Manning(left) & Marvin Harrison(right)<br><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/21/f7/8d/21f78d0d49168b09db654ec9ad7a948a.jpg" width="400" height="300">
<p style="border: 2px Solid MediumSeaGreen;">As for football my favorite team is the Indianapolis Colts, I have been a fan of Peyton Manning & Marvin Harrison ever since I started watching the game as a kid and stuck with the Colts ever since.<br>Peyton Manning is one of the best quarterbacks I have seen play football.<br>My favorite thing about him was the way he was able to recognize defensive schemes and change plays at the line of scrimmage to beat those schemes.<br>With Marvin Harrison, he is one of my favorite wide recievers because of his route running ability and his ability to catch almost anything thrown his way.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2_fiHiQejY&t=9s&ab_channel=CollinTelesz" target="_blank">Watch Marvin Harrison 2006 highlights!</a></p>
